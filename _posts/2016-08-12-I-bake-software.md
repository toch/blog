Recently, I was on the [Ruby Burger chat rooms](https://rubyburgers.herokuapp.com/).
We were discussing a video presenting a company as a great place to work as a software developer. It was full of caricatures such as "ninja".
[Yannick](http://yannick.io), a friend, was then saying the following:

> We are looking for farmer javascript devs
> looking for policeman Java devs

I realize it resonates a lot with me more than "ninja" or "guru" or
whatever-inadequate-adjective-you-could-find-to-make-it-cool. Since I started to
bake my own :bread:, pancakes, brioches, and so on, I embrace the idea of
software development as a craft.

I'm proud to present myself as a **baker dev**. It inspires me to build the
<a href="/">present personal web site</a>. Enjoy!
