## Suggestions and Contributions

English is not my mother tongue, front-end tech is not my strength, and I
consider that I have still a lot to learn. I thank you in advance for your
suggestions and contributions. In the following, you will find how you can do
it.

If you want to suggest me anything, feel free to open an issue about it. It
could be about:

* a better phrasing,
* a topic to cover,
* a possible errors in my statements, etc.

You might want to go a step further and contribute to my website. For instance:
fixing a misspelling, improving the typography, fixing CSS, etc.
